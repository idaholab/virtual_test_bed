The butterfly valve model was tested for a total of five different angles.
For certain configurations  multiple inlet velocities were tested. For 
each input file the only parameters that were changed were the mesh used, 
and the inlet velocity. To use the appropriate inlet velocity boundary 
condition replace the mesh file and u inlet velocity to match the 
corresponding velocity from the table below.

Angle | Flow-Rate (gpm) | Inlet Velocity (m/s)
