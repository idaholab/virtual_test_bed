The Virtual Test Bed (VTB) consists of an [open-source git repository](https://github.com/idaholab/virtual_test_bed) hosting a wide variety of models, primarily based on advanced reactor designs. These models use a variety of codes but primarily use codes developed under the [NEAMS program](https://neams.inl.gov/). This website provides the background and documentation for each model.

## Mission

The VTB is a [National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC)](https://nric.inl.gov/) initiative aiming to facilitate the use of advanced modeling & simulation (M&S) tools developed by the Department of Energy [NEAMS program](https://neams.inl.gov/). Following the passage of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, NRIC was created for accelerating the deployment of these novel reactor concepts. This will be achieved by providing both physical and virtual spaces for building and testing various components, systems, and complete pilot plants. The VTB represents the virtual arm in collaboration with DOE’s NEAMS program.
