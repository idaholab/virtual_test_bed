to download them.

The pebble region in the [!ac](PB-FHR) is enclosed by an outer graphite reflector
that constrains the pebble geometry while also
serving as a reflector for neutrons and a shield for
the reactor barrel and core externals. In order to keep the graphite reflector within
allowable design temperatures, the reflector contains several bypass flow
paths so that a small percentage of the coolant flow, usually on the
order of 5 to 10% of the total flow, can remove heat from the reflector
and maintain the graphite within allowable temperature ranges. This
bypass flow, so-named because coolant is diverted from the pebble region,
is important to quantify during the reactor design process so that accurate
estimates of core cooling and reflector temperatures can be obtained.

This page shows an example of using [nekRS](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
a [!ac](GPU) based [!ac](CFD) code developed by Argonne National Laboratory,
coupled to MOOSE to explore the
conjugate heat transfer in a small region of the [!ac](PB-FHR) reflector. With input
from a full-core coupled Pronghorn-Griffin model, this example can be used to
evaluate hot spots in the reflector and ensure that temperatures
remain within allowable limits. The meshes for this example are created with
programmable scripts; by running these mesh scripts for a range of bypass gap widths
and repeating the flow simulations for a range of Reynolds numbers,
this model can be used to provide friction factor and
Nusselt number correlations as inputs to a full-core Pronghorn model.

The objectives of the present analysis are to:

- Show an example of how non-MOOSE codes can be coupled to MOOSE, and some
  capabilities in this space for thermal-hydraulics analysis. You should
  come away with an understanding of what a "MOOSE-wrapped app" looks like
  and the extent to which MOOSE-wrapped applications behave like other natively-developed
  MOOSE applications.
- Predict the pressure, velocity, and temperature distribution in the
  [!ac](PB-FHR) outer reflector.
- Describe how high-resolution tools such as nekRS can be used to generate
  closure terms (such as friction factor models) for the coarse-mesh tools
  in the MOOSE framework, such as Pronghorn.

!alert note
nekRS uses the [!ac](OCCA) [!ac](API), which allows nekRS to run on both [!ac](CPU) and [!ac](GPU)
systems. However, in this example, nekRS is used with resolved boundary layers, requiring
a fine mesh. This analysis therefore requires [!ac](HPC) resources.
If you do not have access to [!ac](HPC) resources, you will still
find the analysis procedure useful in understanding the MOOSE-wrapped app concept
and opportunities for high-resolution thermal-hydraulics within the MOOSE framework.

## Cardinal and MOOSE-Wrapped Apps

The analysis shown here is performed with Cardinal, a MOOSE application
that "wraps" [nekRS](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
a [!ac](CFD) code, and [OpenMC](https://docs.openmc.org/en/latest/), a Monte Carlo particle transport
code. Cardinal is an open-source application, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/neams-th-coe/cardinal).
As this example focuses on heat transfer modeling, there will be no further
discussion of the OpenMC wrapping in Cardinal.
"Wrapping" means that, for all intents and purposes, nekRS simulations can
be run within the MOOSE framework and interacted with as if the physics
and numerical solution performed by nekRS were a native MOOSE application.
Cardinal contains source code that facilitates data transfers in and out of nekRS
and runs nekRS within a MOOSE-controlled simulation.
At a high level, Cardinal's wrapping of nekRS consists of:

- Constructing a "mirror" of the nekRS mesh through which data transfers occur
  with MOOSE. For conjugate heat transfer applications such as those shown here, a
  [MooseMesh](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/mesh/MooseMesh.html)
   is created by copying the nekRS surface mesh into a format that
  all native MOOSE applications can understand.
- Adding [MooseVariables](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/variables/MooseVariable.html)
  to represent the nekRS solution. In other words,
  if nekRS stores the temperature internally as an `std::vector<double>`, with each
  entry corresponding to a nekRS node, then a [MooseVariable](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/variables/MooseVariable.html)
   is created that represents
  the same data, but that can be accessed in relation to the [MooseMesh](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/mesh/MooseMesh.html)
   mirror.
- Writing multiphysics feedback fields in/out of nekRS's internal solution and boundary
  condition arrays. So, if nekRS represents a heat flux boundary condition internally
  as an `std::vector<double>`, this involves reading from a [MooseVariable](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/variables/MooseVariable.html) representing
  heat flux (which can be transferred with any of MOOSE's transfers to the nekRS
  wrapping) and writing into nekRS's internal vectors.

Accomplishing the above three tasks requires an intimate knowledge of how nekRS
stores its solution fields and mesh. But once the wrapping is constructed, nekRS can
then communicate with any other MOOSE application via the [MultiApp]((https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/MultiApps/index.html)
and [Transfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/index.html) systems
in MOOSE, enabling complex multiscale thermal-hydraulic analysis and multiphysics feedback.
The same wrapping can be used for conjugate heat transfer analysis with *any* MOOSE
application that can compute a heat flux; that is, because a MOOSE-wrapped version of nekRS
interacts with the MOOSE framework in a similar manner as natively-developed
MOOSE applications, the agnostic formulations of the [MultiApps](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/MultiApps/index.html) and
[Transfers](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/index.html) can be
used to equally extract heat flux from Pronghorn, BISON, the MOOSE heat conduction
module, and so on.

!alert tip title=Why Use Cardinal?
Cardinal allows nekRS and OpenMC to couple seamlessly with the MOOSE framework,
enabling in-memory coupling, distributed parallel meshes for very large-scale
applications, and straightforward multiphysics problem setup. Cardinal has
capabilities for conjugate heat transfer coupling of nekRS and MOOSE, concurrent
conjugate heat transfer and volumetric heat source coupling of nekRS and MOOSE,
and volumetric density, temperature, and heat source coupling of OpenMC to MOOSE.
Together, the OpenMC and nekRS wrappings augment MOOSE
by expanding the framework to include high-resolution spectral element [!ac](CFD) and Monte Carlo
particle transport. For conjugate heat transfer applications in particular,
the libMesh-based interpolations of fields between meshes enables fluid-solid
heat transfer simulations on meshes that are not necessarily continuous on phase
interfaces, allowing mesh resolution to be specified based on the underlying physics,
rather than rigid continuity restrictions in single-application heat transfer codes.

The remainder of this page will describe the conjugate heat transfer capabilities
of Cardinal.

## Geometry and Computational Model
  id=model

This section describes the [!ac](PB-FHR) reflector geometry and the simplifications
made in constructing a computational model of this system.

!alert note
This computational model is a simplified version of the actual reflector
geometry and reactor state. Due to limitations in nekRS's boundary conditions,
some geometry approximations will be made. This model is also run independently
of Pronghorn and Griffin, so several assumptions are made regarding fluid boundary
conditions at the inlet to the reflector and along the reflector-pebble bed interface,
even though in reality the flow and heat transfer in the reflector is tightly
coupled to the flow and heat transfer in the bed and the neutron transport
over the entire reactor.
It is important to be aware of these simplifications when assessing the physical predictions
of this model. Nevertheless, these simplifications do not detract from the
ability to use this model to learn about high-resolution conjugate heat transfer
capabilities in the MOOSE framework as long as the simplifications are acknowledged.
The details of this model can be refined for follow-on studies as needed.

A top-down view of the [!ac](PB-FHR) reactor vessel is shown below. This geometry is
based on the specifications given in [!cite](shaver). The center region
is the pebble bed core, which has an outer radius of 2.6 m. Surrounding the
pebble region are two rings of graphite reflector blocks, staggered with
respect to one another in a brick-like fashion. Each ring contains 24 blocks.
The inner ring blocks have a width (i.e. radial thickness) of 0.3 m, while
the outer ring blocks have a width of 0.4 m.
The gaps between the blocks are 0.002 m wide. In black is shown the core barrel,
which is 0.022 m thick. The gap between the outer ring of blocks and the barrel
is ten times larger than the gap between the inner and outer ring of blocks,
or 0.02 m.

!media pbfhr/reflector/top_down.png
  id=top_down
  caption=Top-down schematic of the [!ac](PB-FHR) reactor core (only roughly to scale).
  style=width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto

To ease the difficulty of meshing very narrow slots, as well as
to make visualization and model depiction easier, the width of
the gap between blocks is increased in this example to 0.006 m. Of course, over
the lifetime of the reactor, the gap width changes due to graphite material response
to fluence such that the gap width is not a fixed value. Therefore, we take this
liberty here to improve visualization of the thin gaps, but allow setting the gap
width as an input to the meshing scripts. Gap widths of 0.006 m are not
completely without physical basis; for instance, for the [!ac](THTR),
a maximum 1% shrinkage of the graphite reflector blocks was assumed
[!cite](oehme). Translating this percentage to the [!ac](PB-FHR) geometry corresponds to
gaps of approximately 0.005 m thickness [!cite](novak2021).

To form the entire axial height of the reflector, rings of blocks are stacked
vertically; each block is 0.52 m tall. The entire core height is 5.3175 m, or
about 10 vertical rings of blocks (additional structures at the core inlet and
outlet compose any remaining height not evenly divisible by 0.52 m).

In both the pebble bed region and through the small gaps between the reflector
blocks and between the reflector blocks and the barrel, FLiBe coolant flows. This bypass
flow path is shown as yellow dashed lines in [top_down]; in these gaps, coolant
flows both from the pebble bed and outward in the radial direction, as well as vertically
from lower reflector rings.
Each ring of blocks is separated from the rings above and below it by very thin horizontal
gaps that form as the graphite thermally expands (not shown in [top_down]; these flow paths also
contribute to bypass flows, allowing a second radial flow path from the pebble
bed towards the barrel. For simplicity, this second radial flow path is neglected here.

The total power of the [!ac](PB-FHR) is 236 MW; any power deposition in the reflector is neglected.
The FLiBe inlet temperature to the
core is 600&deg;C, while the nominal outlet temperature is 700&deg;C.

To reduce computational cost, the coupled nekRS-MOOSE simulation is conducted
for a single ring of reflector blocks (i.e. a height of 0.52 m), with azimuthal symmetry assumed to further
reduce the domain to half of an inner ring block, half of an outer ring block,
and the vertical and radial bypass flow paths between the blocks and the barrel. This
computational domain is shown outlined with a red dotted line in the figure above.
As already mentioned, the second radial flow path (along fluid "sheets" between vertically
stacked rings of blocks) is not considered. This geometry, as well
as the boundary conditions imposed, will be
described in much greater detail later when the meshes for the fluid and solid
phases are discussed.

## Governing Equations

This section describes the physics solved in this coupled conjugate heat
transfer problem. Because there are no transient source terms or transient
boundary conditions, the MOOSE heat conduction module will
solve the steady state energy conservation equation for a solid,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hf}
-\nabla\cdot(k_s\nabla T_s)=\dot{q}_s
\end{equation}

where $k_s$ is the solid thermal conductivity, $T_s$ is the solid temperature,
and $\dot{q}_s$ is the solid volumetric heat source, which for this application is zero.
Solving the steady energy conservation
in lieu of the transient equation will accelerate the approach to the coupled pseudo-steady state.

nekRS solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mass}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf u=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:momentum}
\rho_f\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf u}{\partial t}+\mathbf u\cdot\nabla\mathbf u\right)=-\nabla P+\nabla\cdot\tau+\rho\ \mathbf f
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy}
\rho_f C_{p,f}\left(\frac{\partial T_f}{\partial t}+\mathbf u\cdot\nabla T_f\right)=\nabla\cdot\left(k_f\nabla T_f\right)+\dot{q}_f
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf u$ is the fluid velocity, $\rho_f$ is the fluid density, $P$ is the pressure, $\tau$
is the viscous stress tensor, $\mathbf f$ is a source vector, $\dot{q}_f$
is a volumetric heat source, $C_{p,f}$ is the fluid heat capacity,
$T_f$ is the fluid temperature, and $k_f$ is the fluid thermal conductivity. In this example,
both $\mathbf f$ and $\dot{q}_f$ are set to zero for simplicity.

Because the expected temperature range is small (on the order of the nominal
100&deg;C temperature rise divided by 10, since the reflector is approximately 10 rings of
blocks high), all material properties are taken as constant (though this is not a limitation of nekRS).
In addition, the expected flowrate through the reflector block is sufficiently low to be laminar,
so the $k$-$\tau$ turbulence model in nekRS is not needed.

nekRS can be solved in either dimensional or non-dimensional form; in the present case,
nekRS is solved in non-dimensional form. That is, characteristic scales for velocity,
temperature, length, and time are defined and substituted into the governing equations
so that all solution fields (velocity, pressure, temperature) are of order unity.
A full derivation of the non-dimensional governing equations in nekRS is available
[here](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory.html#non-dimensional-formulation).
To summarize, non-dimensional formulations for velocity, pressure, temperature, length,
and time are defined as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_ref}
u_i^\dagger\equiv\frac{u_i}{U_{ref}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_ref}
P^\dagger\equiv\frac{P}{\rho_0U_{ref}^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:T_ref}
T^\dagger\equiv\frac{T-T_{ref}}{\Delta T}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:x_ref}
x_i^\dagger\equiv\frac{x_i}{L_{ref}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t_ref}
t^\dagger\equiv\frac{t}{L_{ref}/U_{ref}}
\end{equation}

where a $\dagger$ superscript indicates a non-dimensional quantity and a "ref" subscript indicates
a characteristic scale. A "0" subscript indicates a reference parameter. Inserting these definitions into
[eq:mass], [eq:momentum], and [eq:energy] gives

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mass_nondim}
\frac{\partial u_i^\dagger}{\partial x_i^\dagger}=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:momentum_nondim}
\rho^\dagger\left(\frac{\partial u_i^\dagger}{\partial t^\dagger}+u_j^\dagger\frac{\partial u_i^\dagger}{\partial x_j^\dagger}\right)=-\frac{\partial P^\dagger}{\partial x_i^\dagger}+\frac{1}{Re}\frac{\partial \tau_{ij}^\dagger}{\partial x_j^\dagger}+\rho^\dagger f_i^\dagger
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy_nondim}
\rho^\dagger C_p^\dagger\left(\frac{\partial T^\dagger}{\partial t^\dagger}+u_i^\dagger\frac{\partial T^\dagger}{\partial x_i^\dagger}\right)=\frac{1}{Pe}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i^\dagger}\left(k^\dagger\frac{\partial T^\dagger}{\partial x_i^\dagger}\right)+\dot{q}^\dagger
\end{equation}

Complete definitions of all terms are
available [here](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory.html#non-dimensional-formulation).
New terms in these non-dimensional equations are $Re$ and $Pe$, the Reynolds and Peclet numbers,
respectively:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Re}
Re\equiv\frac{\rho_0 UL}{\mu_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Pe}
Pe\equiv\frac{LU}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

nekRS solves for $\mathbf u^\dagger$, $P^\dagger$, and $T^\dagger$. Cardinal will handle
conversions from a non-dimensional solution to a dimensional MOOSE heat conduction application,
but awareness of this non-dimensional formulation will be important for describing the
nekRS input files.

In this model, the reference length scale is selected as the block gap width, or $L_{ref}=0.006$. Therefore,
to obtain a mesh with a gap width of unity (in non-dimensional units), the entire nekRS mesh must
be multiplied by $1/0.006$. The characteristic velocity is selected to obtain a Reynolds number of 100,
which corresponds to $U_{ref}=0.0575$ based on the values for density and viscosity for FLiBe
evaluated at 650&deg;C. A Reynolds number of 100 corresponds to a bypass fraction of about 7%, considering
that $Re$ can be written equivalent to [eq:Re] as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Re2}
Re\equiv\frac{\dot{m}L}{A\mu}
\end{equation}

where $\dot{m}$ is the mass flowrate (a fraction of the total core mass flowrate, distributed
among 48 half-reflector blocks) and $A$ is the inlet area. Further parametric studies for other
bypass fractions can be performed by varying the fluid Reynolds and Peclet numbers in the nekRS
input files.

Finally, $T_{ref}$ is taken equal to the inlet temperature of 923.15 K; the
$\Delta T$ parameter is arbitrary, and does not necessarily need to equal any expected temperature rise
in the fluid. So for this example, $\Delta T$ is simply taken equal to 10 K.

### Boundary Conditions

This section describes the boundary conditions imposed on the fluid and solid phases.
When the meshes are described in [#meshes], descriptive words such as "inlet" and "outlet"
will be directly tied to sidesets in the mesh to enhance the verbal description here.

As described earlier, this simulation is performed as a standalone case, independent
of Pronghorn and Griffin - despite the fact that the reflector flow and heat transfer
is tightly coupled to the core thermal-hydraulics. Two simplifications are made:

- The heat flux at the pebble bed-reflector interface is given as a fixed value
  of 5 kW/m$^2$, though this value can also be extracted using a flux
  postprocessor evaluated over the bed-reflector interface in a full-core Pronghorn model.
- The coupled Pronghorn-Griffin [!ac](PB-FHR) model elsewhere in this repository does not model flow through
  the outer reflector - the reflector is treated as a solid conducting block. Therefore,
  this particular full-core [!ac](PB-FHR) model cannot directly provide temperature and velocity boundary
  conditions to the present reflector model. Instead, the inlet boundary conditions
  are also taken as representing some average conditions in the [!ac](PB-FHR) at an
  a priori specified bypass fraction and inlet temperature.

#### Solid Boundary Conditions

For the solid
domain, a fixed heat flux of 5 kW/m$^2$ is imposed on the block surface facing the pebble bed.
On the surface of the barrel, a heat convection boundary condition is imposed,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hfc}
q^{''}=h\left(T_s-T_\infty\right)
\end{equation}

where $q^{''}$ is the heat flux, $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and $T_\infty$
is the far-field ambient temperature.

At fluid-solid interfaces, the solid temperature is imposed as a Dirichlet condition,
where nekRS computes the surface temperature.
Finally, the top and bottom of the block, as well as all symmetry boundaries, are treated
as insulated for simplicity.

#### Fluid Boundary Conditions

At the inlet, the fluid temperature is taken as 650&deg;C, or the nominal
median fluid temperature. The inlet velocity is selected such that the Reynolds number is 100.
At the outlet, a zero pressure is imposed. On the $\theta=0^\circ$ boundary (i.e. the $y=0$ boundary), symmetry is imposed
such that all derivatives in the $y$ direction are zero. All other boundaries are treated as no-slip.

!alert note
The $\theta=7.5^\circ$ boundary (i.e. $360^\circ$ divided by 24 blocks, divided
in half because we are modeling only half a block) should also be imposed as a symmetry
boundary in the nekRS model. However, nekRS is currently limited to symmetry
boundaries only for boundaries aligned with the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinate
axes. Here, a no-slip boundary condition is used instead, so the correspondence of
the nekRS computational model to the depiction in [#model] is imperfect.

At fluid-solid interfaces, the heat flux is imposed as a Neumann condition, where MOOSE
computes the surface heat flux.

### Initial Conditions

Because the nekRS mesh contains very small elements in the fluid phase, fairly small time
steps are required to meet [!ac](CFL) conditions related to stability. Therefore,
the approach to the coupled, pseudo-steady conjugate heat transfer solution can be
accelerated by obtaining initial conditions from a pure conduction simulation. Then, the
initial conditions for the conjugate heat transfer simulation use the temperature obtained
from the conduction simulation, with a uniform axial velocity and zero pressure.
The process to run Cardinal in conduction mode is described in [#part1].

## Meshing
  id=meshes

This section describes how the meshes are generated for MOOSE and nekRS.
For both applications, the Cubit meshing software [!cite](cubit) is used to
programmatically create meshes with user-defined geometry and customizable
boundary layers. Journal files, or Python-scripted Cubit inputs, are used
to create meshes in Exodus II format. The MOOSE framework accepts meshes in
a wide range of formats that can be generated with many commercial and free
meshing tools; Cubit is used for this example because the content creator
is most familiar with this software, though similar meshes can be generated
with your preferred meshing tool.

#### Solid MOOSE Heat Conduction Mesh
  id=solid_mesh

The `solid.jou` file is a Cubit script that is used to generate the solid mesh,
shown below:

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/meshes/solid.jou language=python

At the top of this file, is a `#!python` shebang that allows Python to be used
to programmatically create the mesh. Any valid Python code (including imported
modules) can be used; the actual commands passed to the Cubit
meshing tool are written as `cubit.cmd(<string command>)`, where
`<string command>` is a string containing the Cubit command that, in interactive mode,
would be manually typed into the Cubit command line in the GUI. For complex meshes, scripting
the mesh process is essential for reproducibility and easing the burden of making
modifications to the geometry or mesh.

The complete solid mesh (before a series of refinements) is shown below; the boundary names are illustrated towards
the right by showing only the highlighted surface to which each boundary corresponds.
Names are shown in Courier font. A unique block ID is used for the set of elements
corresponding to the inner ring, outer ring, and barrel. Material properties in MOOSE
are typically restricted by block, and setting three separate IDs allows us to set
different properties in each of these blocks.

!media pbfhr/reflector/solid_mesh.png
  id=solid_mesh
  caption=Solid mesh for the reflector blocks and barrel and a subset of the boundary names, before a series of mesh refinements

Unique boundary names are set for each boundary to which we will apply a unique
boundary condition; we define the boundaries on the top and bottom of the block,
the symmetry boundaries that reflect the fact that we've reduced the full [!ac](PB-FHR)
reflector to a half-block domain, and boundaries at the interface between the
reflector and the bed and on the barrel surface. The boundary that contains
all fluid-solid interfaces through which we will exchange heat flux and temperature
is named `fluid_solid_interface`.

Now that the overall structure of the mesh has been introduced, a brief
description of the process of how the mesh was actually constructed is provided.
First, the block geometry is formed by creating cylinders and bricks and subtracting
them from one another to get angular sectors of cylindrical annuli. Then, the
Cubit `boundary_layer` feature is used to programmatically refine the mesh
near surfaces; we perform this refinement because, on some of these surfaces (those
exchanging heat with the fluid), we expect to have higher
thermal gradients that we would like to resolve with a finer mesh. For each boundary
layer, we specify a starting element width perpendicular to the surface, a growth
factor, and a number of boundary layers we would like to mesh. Finally, the mesh
is saved in Exodus II format to disk.

#### Fluid nekRS Mesh
  id=fluid_mesh

The `fluid.jou` is a Cubit script that is used to generate the fluid mesh, shown below.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/meshes/fluid.jou language=python

The complete fluid mesh is shown below; the boundary names are illustrated towards
the right by showing only the highlighted surface to which each boundary corresponds.
Names are shown in Courier font. While the names of the surfaces are shown in Courier
font, nekRS does not directly use these names - rather, nekRS assigns boundary
conditions based on the numeric value of the boundary name; these are shown as "ID"
in the figure. An important restriction in nekRS is that the boundary IDs be ordered
sequentially beginning from 1.

!media pbfhr/reflector/fluid_mesh.png
  id=fluid_mesh
  caption=Fluid mesh for the FLiBe flowing around the reflector blocks, along with boundary names and IDs. It is difficult to see, but the `porous_inner_surface` boundary corresponds to the thin surface at the interface between the reflector region and the pebble bed.

A strength of Cardinal for conjugate heat transfer applications
is that the fluid and solid meshes do not need to share nodes on a common surface; libMesh
mesh-to-mesh data interpolations apply to surfaces of very different refinement and position in
space; meshes may even overlap, such as for curvilinear applications. [zoom_mesh] shows
a zoom-in of the two mesh files (for the fluid and solid phases); rather than being limited
with a continuous mesh mapping from the fluid phase inwards to the solid phase, each phase
can be meshed according to its physics requirements.

!media pbfhr/reflector/zoom_mesh.png
  id=zoom_mesh
  caption=Zoomed-in view of the fluid and solid meshes, overlaid in Paraview. Lines are element boundaries.
  style=width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto

Creating the fluid mesh is significantly more involved than creating the solid mesh.
First, a series of boolean operations is performed to obtain an un-meshed volume
that the fluid will flow through. Rather than create a single volume, the fluid region
is created as 7 separate volumes; this allows full customzation of the meshing near the
corners where we would like the boundary layer scheme to extend from the interior corners
(with angles greater than 180 degrees) across the fluid gaps. Like the solid mesh,
boundary layers are applied on all surfaces (even if the particular boundary condition
on a surface is not necessarily "no-slip"). Finally, the boundary IDs are created; while
names are assigned in the Cubit script, these names are not accessible to nekRS, and the
numeric boundary IDs are instead used for designating boundaries.

Because nekRS uses a custom binary mesh format with a `.re2` extension, a conversion utility
must be used to convert an Exodus II format to nekRS's `.re2` nekRS format. This utility, or the `exo2nek` program,
requires the Exodus mesh elements to be type `HEX20` (a twenty-node hexahedral element),
so we set this element type from Cubit. Instructions for building
the `exo2nek` program are available [here](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/detailed_usage.html).
After this script has been compiled, you simply need to run

```
$ exo2nek
```

and then follow the prompts for the information that must be added about the mesh
to perform the conversion. Above, `$` indicates the terminal prompt.
For this example, there is no solid mesh, there are no periodic surface pairs,
and we want a scaling factor of $1/0.006$ (for the non-dimensional formulation)
and no translation. The last part of the `exo2nek` program will request
a name for the fluid `.re2` mesh; providing `fluid` then will create the nekRS
mesh, named `fluid.re2`.

## Part 1: Initial Conduction Coupling
  id=part1

In this section, nekRS and MOOSE are coupled for conduction heat transfer in the solid reflector
blocks and barrel, and through a stagnant fluid. The purpose of this stage of
the analysis is to obtain a restart file for use as an initial condition in [#part2] to accelerate the nekRS
calculation for conjugate heat transfer, since the energy equation is slowest to converge.

All input files for this stage of the analysis are present in the
`pbfhr/reflector/conduction` directory. The following sub-sections describe these files.

### Solid Input Files

The solid phase is solved with the MOOSE heat conduction module, and are described in the `solid.i` input.
At the top of this file, the core heat flux is defined as a variable local to the file.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  end=Mesh

The value of this variable can then be used anywhere else in the input file
with syntax like `${core_heat_flux}`, similar to bash syntax. Next, the solid mesh is
specified by pointing to the Exodus mesh generated in [#solid_mesh].

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Mesh
  end=Variables

The heat conduction module will solve for temperature, which is defined as a nonlinear
variable.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Variables
  end=AuxVariables

The [Transfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/index.html)
 system in MOOSE is used to communicate auxiliary variables across applications;
a boundary heat flux will be computed by MOOSE and applied as a boundary condition in nekRS.
In the opposite direction, nekRS will compute a surface temperature that will be applied as
a boundary condition in MOOSE. Therefore, both the flux (`flux`) and surface temperature
(`nek_temp`) are declared as auxiliary variables. The solid app will *compute* `flux`,
while `nek_temp` will simply *receive* a solution from the nekRS sub-application. The flux
is computed as a constant monomial field (a single value per element) due to the manner in
which material properties are accessible in auxiliary kernels in MOOSE.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=AuxVariables
  end=Functions

In this example, the overall calculation workflow is as follows:

- Run MOOSE heat conduction with a given surface temperature distribution from nekRS.
- Send heat flux to nekRS as a boundary condition.
- Run nekRS with a given surface heat flux distribution from MOOSE.
- Send surface temperature to MOOSE as a boundary condition.

The above sequence is repeated until convergence of the coupled domain. For the very first
time step, an initial condition should be set for `nek_temp`; this is done using a function
with an arbitrary, but not wholly unrealistic, distribution for the fluid temperature. That
function is then used as an initial condition with a `FunctionIC` object.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Functions
  end=Kernels

Next, the governing equation solved by MOOSE is specified with the `Kernels` block as the
`HeatConduction` kernel, or $-\nabla\cdot(k\nabla T)=0$. An auxiliary kernel is also specified
for the `flux` variable that specifies that the flux on the `fluid_solid_interface` boundary
should be computed as $-k\nabla T\cdot\hat{n}$.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Kernels
  end=BCs

Next, the boundary conditions on the solid are applied. On the fluid-solid interface,
a [MatchedValueBC](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/bcs/MatchedValueBC.html)
 applies the value of the `nek_temp` receiver auxiliary variable
to `T` in a strong Dirichlet sense. Insulated boundary conditions are applied on the `symmetry`,
`top`, and `bottom` boundaries. On the boundary at the bed-reflector interface, the
core heat flux is specified as a `NeumannBC`. Finally, on the surface of the barrel,
a heat flux of $h(T-T_\infty)$ is specified, where both $h$ and $T_\infty$ are specified
as material properties.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=BCs
  end=Materials

The `HeatConduction` kernel requires a material property for the thermal conductivity;
material properties are also required for the heat transfer coefficient and far-field
temperature for the `ConvectiveHeatFluxBC`. These material properties are specified
in the `Materials` block. Here, different values for thermal conductivity are used
in the graphite and steel.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Materials
  end=MultiApps

Next, the [MultiApps](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/MultiApps/index.html)
 and [Transfers](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/index.html)
blocks describe the interaction between Cardinal
and MOOSE. The MOOSE heat conduction module is here run as the main application, with
the nekRS wrapping run as the sub-application. We specify that MOOSE will run first on each
time step. Allowing sub-cycling means that, if the MOOSE time step is 0.05 seconds, but
the nekRS time step is 0.02 seconds, that for every MOOSE time step, nekRS will perform
three time steps, of length 0.02, 0.02, and 0.01 seconds to "catch up" to the MOOSE main
application. If sub-cycling is turned off, then the smallest time step among all the various
applications is used.

Three transfers are required to couple Cardinal and MOOSE; the first is a transfer
of surface temperature from Cardinal to MOOSE. The second is a transfer of heat flux from
MOOSE to Cardinal. And the third is a transfer of the total integrated heat flux from MOOSE
to Cardinal (computed as a postprocessor), which is then used internally by nekRS to re-normalize the heat flux (after
interpolation onto its [!ac](GLL) points).

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=MultiApps
  end=Postprocessors

!alert note
For transfers between two native MOOSE applications, you can ensure
conservation of a transferred field using the `from_postprocessors_to_be_preserved` and
`to_postprocessors_to_be_preserved` options available to any class inheriting from
[MultiAppConservativeTransfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/source/transfers/MultiAppConservativeTransfer.html).
However, proper conservation of a field within nekRS (which uses a completely different
spatial discretization from MOOSE) requires performing such conservations in nekRS itself.
Hence, an integral postprocessor must explicitly be passed in this case.

Next, postprocessors are used to compute the integral heat flux as a
[SideIntegralVariablePostprocessor](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/postprocessors/SideIntegralVariablePostprocessor.html).

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Postprocessors
  end=Executioner

Next, the solution methodology is specified. Although the solid phase only
includes time-independent kernels, the heat conduction is run as a transient because nekRS
ultimately must be run as a transient (nekRS lacks a steady solver). A nonlinear tolerance
of $10^{-6}$ is used for each solid time step, and the overall coupled simulation is considered
converged once the relative change in the solution between steps is less than $5\times10^{-4}$.
Finally, an output format of Exodus II is specified.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/solid.i
  start=Executioner

### Fluid Input Files
  id=fluid_model

The fluid phase is solved with Cardinal, which under-the-hood performs the solution with nekRS.
The wrapping of nekRS as a MOOSE
application is specified in the `nek.i` file.
Compared to the solid input file, the fluid input file is quite minimal, as the specification
of the nekRS problem setup is mostly performed using the nekRS input files that would be required to
run nekRS as a standalone application.

First, a local variable, `fluid_solid_interface`, is used to define all the boundary IDs through which nekRS is coupled
via conjugate heat transfer to MOOSE for convenience. Next, a `NekRSMesh`, a class specific to Cardinal, is
used to construct a "mirror" of the surfaces in the nekRS mesh through which boundary condition
coupling is performed. In order for MOOSE's [MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestLocationTransfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/transfers/MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestLocationTransfer.html)
to correctly match nodes in the solid mesh to nodes in this fluid mesh mirror, the entire mesh must be
scaled by a factor of $L_{ref}$ to return to dimensional units.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/nek.i
  end=Problem

Next, the [Problem](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Problem/index.html)
 block describes all objects necessary for the actual physics solve; for
the solid input file, the default of [FEProblem](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/problems/FEProblem.html)
was implicitly assumed.  However, to replace MOOSE finite element calculations with nekRS
spectral element calculations, a Cardinal-specific `NekRSProblem` class is used. Like all
MOOSE-wrapped apps, the problem class that wraps nekRS derives from
[ExternalProblem](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/problems/ExternalProblem.html).
To allow conversion between a non-dimensional nekRS solve and a dimensional MOOSE coupled
heat conduction application, the characteristic scales used to establish the non-dimensional
problem are provided.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/nek.i
  start=Problem
  end=Executioner

Next, a [Transient](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/executioners/Transient.html) executioner
is specified. This is the same executioner used for the solid case, except now a
Cardinal-specific time stepper, `NekTimeStepper` is provided. This time stepper simply
reads the time step specified in nekRS's `.par` file (to be described shortly),
and converts it to dimensional form if needed. An Exodus II output format is specified.
It is important to note that this output file only outputs the temperature and heat
flux solutions on the surface mirror mesh; the solution over the entire nekRS domain is output
with the usual `.fld` field file format used by standalone nekRS calculations.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/nek.i
  start=Executioner
  end=Postprocessors

Finally, several postprocessors are included. A postprocessor named `flux_integral`
is added automatically by `NekRSProblem` to receive the value of the heat flux
integral from MOOSE for internal normalization in nekRS.
The other three postprocessors are all Cardinal-specific postprocessors that perform
integrals and global min/max calculations over the nekRS domain. Here, the `boundary_flux`
postprocessor computes $-k\nabla T\cdot\hat{n}$ over a boundary in the nekRS mesh. This
value should approximately match the imposed heat flux, `flux_integral`, though perfect
agreement is not to be expected since flux boundary conditions are only weakly imposed
in the spectral element method. The `max_nek_T` and `min_nek_T` then compute the maximum
and minimum temperatures throughout the entire nekRS domain (i.e. not only on the conjugate
heat transfer coupling surfaces).

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/nek.i
  start=Postprocessors

!alert note
Note that `fluid.re2` does not appear anywhere in `nek.i` - the `fluid.re2` file is
a mesh used directly by nekRS, while `NekRSMesh` is a mirror of the boundaries in `fluid.re2`
through which boundary coupling with MOOSE will be performed.

You will likely notice that many of the almost-always-included MOOSE blocks are absent
from the `nek.i` input file - for instance, there are no nonlinear or auxiliary variables.
The `NekRSProblem` assists in input file setup by declaring many of these coupling fields
automatically. For this example, two auxiliary variables named `temp` and `avg_flux` are
added automatically; these variables receive incoming and outgoing transfers to/from nekRS.
You will see both `temp` and `avg_flux` referred to in the solid input file `Transfers` section.

In addition, the `nek.i` input file only describes how nekRS is wrapped within the MOOSE framework;
with the `fluid.re2` mesh file, each nekRS simulation requires at least three
additional files, that share the same case name `fluid` but with different extensions.
The additional nekRS files are:

- `fluid.par`: High-level settings for the solver, boundary
  condition mappings to sidesets, and the equations to solve.
- `fluid.udf`: User-defined C++ functions for on-line postprocessing and model setup
- `fluid.oudf`: User-defined [!ac](OCCA) kernels for boundary conditions and
  source terms

A detailed description of all of the available parameters, settings, and use cases
for these input files is available on the
[nekRS documentation website](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input_files.html).
Because the purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate Cardinal's capabilties, only
the aspects of nekRS required to understand the present case will be covered. First,
begin with the `fluid.par` file, shown in entirety below.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/fluid.par

The input consists of blocks and parameters. The `[GENERAL]` block describes the
time stepping, simulation end control, and the polynomial order. Here, a time step
of 0.025 (non-dimensional) is used; a nekRS output file is written every 100 time steps.
Because nekRS is run as a sub-application to MOOSE, the `stopAt` and `numSteps`
fields are actually ignored, so that the steady state tolerance in the MOOSE main
application dictates when a simulation terminates. Because the purpose of this
simulation is only to obtain a reasonable initial condition, a low polynomial order
of 2 is used.

Next, the `[VELOCITY]` and `[PRESSURE]` blocks describe the solution of the
pressure Poisson equation and velocity Helmholtz equations. In the velocity block,
setting `solver = none` turns off the velocity solution; therefore, none of the
parameters specified here are of consequence, so their description will be deferred
to [#part2]. Finally, the `[TEMPERATURE]` block describes the solution of the
temperature passive scalar equation. $\rho_fC_{p,f}$ is set to unity because the
solve is conducted in non-dimensional form, such that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nek1}
\rho^\dagger C_{p,f}^\dagger\equiv\frac{\rho_fC_{p,f}}{\rho_0C_{p,0}}=1
\end{equation}

The coefficient on the diffusive equation term, as shown in [eq:energy_nondim],
is equal to $1/Pe$. In nekRS, specifying `conductivity = -1500.5` is equivalent
to specifying `conductivity = 0.00066644` (i.e. $1/1500.5$), or a Peclet number of
1500.5.

Next, `residualTol` specifies the solver tolerance for the temperature equation
to $10^{-8}$. Finally, the `boundaryTypeMap` is used to specify the mapping of
boundary IDs to types of boundary conditions. nekRS uses short character strings
to represent the type of boundary condition; boundary conditions used in this example
include:

- `W`: no-slip wall
- `symy`: symmetry in the $y$-direction
- `v`: user-defined velocity
- `o`: zero-gradient outlet
- `f`: user-defined flux
- `I`: insulated
- `t`: user-defined temperature

Therefore, in reference to [fluid_mesh], boundaries 1, 2, and 7 are flux boundaries
(these boundaries will receive a heat flux from MOOSE), boundaries 3, 4, and 8 are
insulated, boundary 5 is a specified temperature, and boundary 6 is a zero-gradient
outlet. The actual assignment of numeric values to these boundary conditions is then
performed in the `fluid.oudf` file. The `fluid.oudf` file contains [!ac](OCCA) kernels that
will be run on a [!ac](GPU) (if present). Because this case does not have any user-defined
source terms in nekRS, these [!ac](OCCA) kernels are only used to apply boundary conditions.
The `fluid.oudf` file is shown below.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/fluid.oudf language=cpp

The names of these functions correspond to the boundary conditions that were applied
in the `.par` file - only the user-defined temperature and flux boundaries require user
input in the `.oudf` file. For each function, the `bcData` object contains all information
about the current boundary that is "calling" the function; `bc->id` is the boundary ID,
`bc->s` is the scalar (temperature) solution at the present [!ac](GLL) point, and
`bc->flux` is the flux (of temperature) at the present [!ac](GLL) point. The
`bc->usrwrk` array is a scratch space to which the heat flux values coming from MOOSE are
written. These OCCA functions then get called directly within nekRS.

Finally, the `fluid.udf` file contains C++ functions that are user-defined functions through
which interaction with the nekRS solution are performed. Here, the `UDF_Setup` function
is called once at the very start of the nekRS simulation, and it is here that initial
conditions are applied. The `fluid.udf` file is shown below.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/conduction/fluid.udf language=cpp

The initial condition is applied manually by looping over all
the [!ac](GLL) points and setting zero to each (recall that this is a non-dimensional
simulation, such that $T^\dagger=0$ corresponds to a dimensional temperature of $T_{ref}$).
Here, `nrs->cds->S` is the array holding the nekRS passive scalar solutions (of which
there is only one for this example; for simulations with a $k$-$\tau$ turbulence model,
additional scalars would be present).

### Execution and Postprocessing
  id=ep

To run the pseudo-steady conduction model, run the following from a command line or
through a job submission script on a [!ac](HPC) system.

```
$ mpiexec -np 48 cardinal-opt -i solid.i
```

where `mpiexec` is an [!ac](MPI) compiler wrapper, `-np 48` indicates that the input
should be run with 48 processes, and `-i solid.i` specifies the input file to run in Cardinal.
Both MOOSE and nekRS will be run
with 48 processes.

When the simulation has completed, you will have created a number of different output files:

- `fluid0.f<n>`, where `<n>` is a five-digit number indicating the output file number
  created by nekRS (a separate output file is written for each time step written to file
  according to the settings in the `fluid.par` file). An extra program is required to visualize
  nekRS output files in Paraview; see the instructions [here](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/detailed_usage.html#visualizing-output-files).
- `solid_out.e`, an Exodus II output file with the solid mesh and solution.
- `solid_out_nek0.e`, an Exodus II output file with the fluid mirror mesh
  and data that was ultimately transferred in/out of nekRS.

After converting the nekRS output files to a format viewable in Paraview, the simulation
results can be displayed. The solid temperature, surface heat flux, and fluid temperature
are shown below. Note that the fluid temperature is shown in nondimensional form based on
the selected characteristic scales. The image of the fluid solution is rotated so as to
better display the temperature variation around the inner reflector block.
The domain shown in [solid_steady_flux] exactly corresponds to the "mirror" mesh
constructed by `NekRSMesh`.

  style=width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto

The solid blocks are heated by the pebble bed along the bed-reflector interface, so the
temperatures are highest in the inner block. As can be seen in [solid_steady_flux], the
heat flux into the fluid is in some places positive (such as near the inner reflector block)
and is in other places negative (such as near the barrel) where heat leaves the system.

## Part 2: Conjugate Heat Transfer Coupling
  id=part2

In this section, nekRS and MOOSE are coupled for conjugate heat transfer between the FLiBe coolant
and the reflector blocks and barrel. All input files for this stage of the analysis are present in the
`pbfhr/reflector/cht` directory. The following sub-sections describe all of these files; for
brevity, most emphasis will be placed on input file setup that is different or extends the
conduction case in [#part1].

### Solid Input Files

The solid phase is again solved with the MOOSE heat conduction module.
The input file is essentially the same as the conduction case, so is not discussed further.

### Fluid Input Files

The fluid phase is again solved with nekRS wrapped as a MOOSE app via Cardinal. The
input file is largely the same as the conduction case, except that additional
postprocessors are added to query both the thermal and hydraulic aspects of the nekRS
solution. The postprocessors used for the nekRS wrapping are shown below.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/cht/nek.i
  start=Postprocessors

We have added postprocessors to compute the average inlet pressure, and the average
inlet and outlet mass flowrates. Like the `NekVolumeExtremeValue`, these postprocessors
operate directly on nekRS's internal solution arrays to provide diagnostic information.
Because the outlet pressure is set to zero, `pressure_in` corresponds to the pressure
drop in the fluid.

As in [#part1], four additional files are required to set up the nekRS simulation -
`fluid.re2`, `fluid.par`, `fluid.udf`, and `fluid.oudf`. These files are largely the
same as those used in the steady conduction model, so only the differences will be
emphasized here.

The `fluid.par` file is shown below. Here, `startFrom` provides a restart file,
`conduction.fld` and specifies that we only want to read temperature from the
file (by appending `+T` to the file name). We increase the polynomial order as well.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/cht/fluid.par

In the `[VELOCITY]` block, the density is set to unity, because the solve is conducted
in nondimensional form, such that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nondim_p}
\rho^\dagger\equiv\frac{\rho_f}{\rho_0}=1
\end{equation}

The coefficient on the diffusive term, as shown in [eq:momentum_nondim], is equal to
$1/Re$. In nekRS, specifying `diffusivity = -100.0` is equivalent to specifying
`diffusivity = 0.001` (i.e. $1/100.0$), or a Reynolds number of 100.0. All other parameters
have similar interpretations as described in [#part1].

The `fluid.udf` file is shown below. The `UDF_Setup` function is again used to apply initial
conditions; because temperature is read from the restart file, only initial conditions on
velocity and pressure are required. `nrs->U` is an array storing the three components of
velocity (padded with length `nrs->fieldOffset`), while `nrs->P` is the array storing the
pressure solution. Due to the non-dimensional formulation, all values for the axial
velocity are set to unity.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/cht/fluid.udf language=cpp

This file also includes the `UDF_LoadKernels` function, which is used to propagate
quantities to variables accessibly through [!ac](OCCA) kernels. The `kernelInfo`
object is used to define two variables - `Vz` and `inlet_T` that will be accessible
through the [!ac](GPU) kernels, eliminating some burden on the user if the problem
setup must be changed in multiple locations throughout the nekRS input files.

Finally, the `fluid.oudf` file is shown below. Because the velocity is enabled,
additional boundary condition functions must be specified in addition to those
in [#part1]. The `velocityDirichletConditions` function applies Dirichlet
conditions to velocity, where `bc->u` is the $x$-component of velocity,
`bc->v` is the $y$-component of velocity, and `bc->w` is the $z$-component of velocity.
In this function, the kernel variable `Vz` that was defined in the `fluid.udf` file
is accessible to simplify the boundary condition setup. The other boundary conditions,
the Dirichlet temperature conditions and the Neumann heat flux conditions, are the
same as for the steady conduction case.

!listing /pbfhr/reflector/cht/fluid.oudf language=cpp

### Execution and Postprocessing

The instructions to run the conjugate heat transfer model are the same as those
given in [#ep]. The temperature and heat flux distributions are qualitatively quite
similar to those in [#part1] because temperature differences across the block
gaps are not very large. Therefore, only the fluid pressure and velocity distributions
are shown below, both in non-dimensional form.

!media pbfhr/reflector/fhr_pressure.png
  id=pressure_cht
  caption=Pressure (nondimensional) for conjugate heat transfer coupling between MOOSE and nekRS
  style=width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto

!media pbfhr/reflector/fhr_velocity.png
  id=velocity_cht
  caption=Velocity (nondimensional) for conjugate heat tranfser coupling between MOOSE and nekRS
  style=width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto

The no-slip condition on the solid surface,
and the symmetry condition on the $y=0$ surface, are clear in [velocity_cht]. The pressure
loss is highest in the gap along the $\theta=7.5^\circ$ boundary due to the imposition of
no-slip conditions on both sides of the half-gap width due to limitations in nekRS's
boundary conditions. Therefore, these pressure predictions are likely to change once nekRS's
symmetry conditions are expanded to non-$x$/$y$/$z$-aligned surfaces.

## Pronghorn Closures

This analysis has only predicted the conjugate heat transfer solution for a single value of
Reynolds number and a single value of gap width. This section briefly describes the procedure
necessary to use Cardinal for generating porous media closures for Pronghorn - specifically,
the friction coefficient. Pronghorn's momentum conservation equation contains a distributed loss
term [!cite](pronghorn_manual) that relates the friction pressure drop to a closure, $W$,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:W}
\epsilon\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}=-W_{ij}\rho_fV_j
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon$ is the porosity, $W$ is a diagonal tensor that is related to the conventional
definition of a friction coefficient, and $V$ is the interstitial velocity. The present
model can be used to predict $W$ as a function of the block geometry and the Reynolds number.
The calculation workflow would be as follows:

1. Re-run the `solid.jou` and `fluid.jou` scripts for a range of block gap widths.
2. Re-run the steady conduction initial condition calculation in [#part1] and the
   conjugate heat transfer calculation in [#part2] for the range of block gap widths,
   for a range of Reynolds numbers.
3. For each individual run, compute the overall porosity of the block-fluid domain,
   and express $\partial P/\partial x_i$ in [eq:W] as $\Delta P/H$, where $\Delta P$
   is the pressure drop given by the `pressure_in` postprocessor in the
   `nek.i` input file, and $H$ is the height of the block, or 0.52 m.
4. Correlate the pressure drop results according to [eq:W] and obtain a functional fit
   to $W$ (with terms linear and quadratic in velocity, according to dimensional
   considerations for pressure loss).
5. Use a `FunctionAnisotropicDragCoefficients` friction factor model in Pronghorn,
   and provide the functional fit in the Pronghorn input file for the linear and
   quadratic terms in `Darcy_coefficient` (the linear proportionality) and
   `Forchheimer_coefficient` (the quadratic proportionality).

An example showing this workflow for the [!ac](PB-FHR) (albeit with a significantly
different reflector block geometry) using COMSOL is available in the literature
[!cite](novak2021).

Similar calculation procedures would be used to predict the Nusselt number, or other
porous media closures such as effective solid conductivities - parameterize the
operating space and geometry that affects the physics of interest, run repeated
high-resolution calculations, and correlate the data into a form that can then
be inserted into Pronghorn using existing material property classes.
