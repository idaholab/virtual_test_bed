# Griffin steady state input

We will first cover the input for the main application, Griffin, which tackles the neutronics
problem. While the Griffin manual is ultimately the most complete reference on this input, we will
try to provide enough details here for a complete comprehension of this input.

We first define in the header:

- initial conditions for the temperatures. These may be specified directly in the AuxVariables block,
  and will be overriden by the values provided by the thermal hydraulics solve.

- the core power.

- the percent of power generated by decay heat. There is no decay heat generation in this input, though
  Griffin has the capability to handle decay heat generation.


The next block is a [GlobalParams](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/GlobalParams/index.html) block. These parameters will be inserted in every block in the input,
and are used to reduce the size of the input file. Here we specify the group cross section library. We will give
additional details about the group cross sections in the [Materials](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/syntax/Materials/) block.

The `[TransportSystems]` block is used to specify the solver parameters. We chose a diffusion solver
as accuracy is generally satisfactory with graphite-moderated reactors, as we confirmed by benchmarking
with Serpent [!citep](giudicelli2021). We select the `eigenvalue` equation type as the steady state coupling is an
eigenvalue calculation for neutron transport. The steady state is the eigenpair of the $k_{eff}$ and the
steady flux distribution. We also specify the boundary conditions in this block. This is a 2D RZ model,
so the center of the geometry is an axis of symmetry. A vacuum boundary condition is placed on the other
boundaries. This approximation is appropriate when the boundaries are sufficiently far from the active region.

The next part of the input specifies the geometry. The geometry in MOOSE is described by an unstructured mesh.
MOOSE also contains basic mesh generation capabilities which can be leveraged to generated rectilinear meshes.
However, for realistic reactor models, it is more common to use an external meshing software. We used [Cubit](https://cubit.sandia.gov/) to
generate meshes for the Mk1-FHR. The mesh may be shared between applications, but it is generally recommended to
tailor the mesh to the physics equations being solved. We specify the external mesh using a [FileMeshGenerator](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/meshgenerators/FileMeshGenerator.html).

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=Mesh/mesh_reader

This mesh is then modified using MOOSE mesh generators. We remove the brick insulation from the system using a
[BlockDeletionGenerator](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/meshgenerators/BlockDeletionGenerator.html) as its influence on the neutronics is negligible. Before that, we added a sideset, a
collection of element sides, to the mesh. This new sideset is used to define the boundary condition for the outer
boundary of the core.

Variables and kernels need not be defined when using Griffin, as the `TransportSystems` block is an [Action](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/actions/Action.html) in
MOOSE vocabulary that takes care of defining those. We will explain those blocks more in details for the Pronghorn
input, which does not use an [Action](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/actions/Action.html).

[AuxVariables](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/AuxVariables/) are used to define fields/variables that are not solved for. They may be used for coupling, for
computing material properties, for outputting quantities of interests, and many other uses. In this input file,
`Tfuel` and `Tsalt` are used to couple to the thermal hydraulics simulation. These fields are populated by
[Transfers](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/) from the Pronghorn app, further in the input file.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=AuxVariables/Tfuel AuxVariables/Tsalt

The `CR_insertion` auxiliary variable is the insertion of the control rod in the system.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=AuxVariables/CR_insertion

The next three [AuxVariables](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/AuxVariables/) are the fission, decay heat and total power densities. They are computed
from `inst_power_density` which is computed by Griffin. The decay heat is important to track for loss of flow
transients, the total power density will be required as the heat source in the thermal hydraulics simulation.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=AuxVariables/fission_power_density AuxVariables/decay_heat_power_density AuxVariables/decay_heat_power_density

The fluxes output by Griffin are normalized with regards to the solver fission source. To output the physical fluxes
normalized to the real core power, which may be used to compute material damage in the fuel for example,
we define the `scaled_sflux_gi` [AuxVariables](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/AuxVariables/).

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=AuxVariables/scaled_sflux_g0

[AuxKernels](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/syntax/AuxKernels/) are used to operate on [AuxVariables](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/AuxVariables/). They may scale, multiply, add and perform many other operations.
They may be block restricted, as some [AuxVariables](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/AuxVariables/) are not defined over the entire domain, or they may inherit the
same block restriction as the variable.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=AuxKernels

Functions may be defined in MOOSE in a [Functions](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Functions/index.html) block. The control rod position is set in this input using
a function. Since it's a steady state calculation, we could also have simply used an initial condition. The
[FunctionAux](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/auxkernels/FunctionAux.html) is using the function to set the `CR_insertion` auxiliary variable.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=Functions

Grffin uses the `PowerDensity` as a shorthand to define variables and postprocessors related to the power of the
core. The following fields are used:

- power: to define the numerical value of the core power

- power_density_variable: a variable for the power density distribution

- integrated_power_postprocessor: a postprocessor to compute the total core power

- power_scaling_postprocessor: a postprocessor used to scale the fluxes to the real core power


The `CONSTANT MONOMIAL` basis is used to represent the power distribution. This will be able to match the
discontinuities in the fission group cross sections

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=PowerDensity

The group cross secions are distributed through the geometry using the [Materials](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/syntax/Materials/) block. Each block in this
section is a `Material` object defining the group cross section in a block. We will go over the `pebble_bed`
material, the group cross section of the salt-pebble homogenized mixture in the bed.

The `CoupledFeedbackNeutronicsMaterial` is used to take into account the effect of the fuel and salt temperature on
the group cross section. The cross section library name and the file containing it are specified using the
[GlobalParams](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/GlobalParams/index.html) block. The temperature dependence is captured using a tabulation. The names used in the tabulation
are matched to the variables in the simulation using `grid_names` and `grid_variables`. The correct entry in the
library is selected using the `material_id`. Since macroscopic group cross sections are used, the isotopes aren't
specified and a pseudo-isotope is used.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=Materials/inner_reflector

The boundary conditions were already specified by the `TransportSystems` action so no additional boundary condition
is specified.

The [Executioner](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/executioners/Executioner.html) block specifies how to solve the equation system. We choose an eigenvalue executioner,
`Eigenvalue`, as a criticality calculation is an eigenvalue problem.

The number of non-linear iterations and the non-linear relative and absolute convergence criteria may be
respectively reduced and loosened to reduce the computational cost of the solution at the expense of its
convergence.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=Executioner

The Pronghorn sub-application is created by the [MultiApps](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/MultiApps/index.html) block. Since we are seeking a steady state solution, we
want the thermal hydraulics problem to be fully solved at every multiphysics iteration. This is accomplished by a
[FullSolveMultiApp](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/multiapps/FullSolveMultiApp.html). The `execute_on` field is set to `timestep_end` to have the thermal hydraulics solve be
performed after the neutronics solve. This means that for the first multiphysics iteration, the temperature fields
in the neutronics solve will be set to an initial guess, while the power distribution in the thermal hydraulics
solve will be updated once already. `0 0 0` is specified for the position since the two meshes are aligned.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=MultiApps

The coupling to the thermal hydraulics simulation is done by using a [MultiAppProjectionTransfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/transfers/MultiAppProjectionTransfer.html) of the power
density. This transfer is conservative, in that the total power in both applications is preserved. This is
important for the multiphysics coupling, as the power will not fluctuate in the thermal hydraulics simulation based
on the power density profile and the difference between the neutronics and thermal hydraulics meshes.
[MultiAppInterpolationTransfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/transfers/MultiAppInterpolationTransfer.html) are used to transfer the solid and fluid phase temperature fields. Conservation is
not as important in this direction, as discretization errors on the temperature do not propagate to large errors in
the flux distribution.

!listing /pbfhr/mark1/steady/ss0_neutrons.i block=Transfers

The `[RestartVariables]` block is commented out, but it may be used to quickly recover the solution from a previous
run instead of calculating it again. It is important that both main and auxiliary variables are recovered. As the
multiapp is executed at the end of the timestep, the restarted solver would not have access to the coupled
calculation temperature fields when it restarts.

Finally, the [Outputs](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Outputs/index.html) block indicates which types of outputs the simulation should return. We specify here three
types:

- exodus. [Exodus](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/outputs/Exodus.html) files contain the mesh, the (aux)variables and global quantities such as postprocessors. We can
  use Paraview to view the spatial dependence of each field. They may be used to restart simulations.

- comma-separated values, or [csv](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/outputs/CSV.html). This file reports the values of the postprocessors at each timestep. They are
  useful for easily importing then plotting the simulation results using Python or Matlab.

- checkpoint files. [Checkpoint](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/outputs/Checkpoint.html) files are used solely for restarting simulations. Unlike Exodus files, they also
  contain all the subapp information, so only the main app checkpoint files are necessary. Checkpoint files are
  output at a regular interval, specified by the `num_files` field.
