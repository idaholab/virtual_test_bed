We include two example cases of coupling multiple subchannel models (`SCM`) with a 3D heat conduction model (`MOOSE`) of the wrapper and inter-wrapper. The wrapper is the hexagonal duct that contains the subchannel assemblies and the inter-wrapper is the space in-between the ducts. A picture of the wrapper and inter-wrapper for the case of 19 assemblies is shown in [inter-wrapper]

## Example Description

One example models 7 subchannel assemblies with a heat conduction model of the wrapper/inter-wrapper and the other one models 19 subchannel assemblies with a heat conduction model of the wrapper/inter-wrapper. In both models subchannel simulations are run as a `MultiApp` and heat conduction as the main app. The wrapper material is steel and the inter-wrapper is liquid sodium. Both materials are treated as solids and only heat conduction is considered. In the 7 assembly case  the central assembly has twice the power of its neighbors. In the 19 assembly case or assemblies have the same power.

## Coupling scheme

The coupling approach is that of domain decomposition. The main app calculates the temperature field in the wrapper and inter-wrapper regions. Based on the temperature field it calculates the heat-flux $(W/m^2)$ on the inner surface of the wrapper (inner surface of the hexagonal ducts) and transfers that information to the equivalent duct model of SCM. The calculated heat-flux by the heat conduction model for the 7 assemblies case is shown in [heat-flux]

The heat-flux transfered to the duct model of SCM is shown in [heat-flux2].

We show in [heat-flux2] two out of the seven SCM inner ducts. The center inner duct and one neighbor. In the 7 assembly case, the central assembly has twice the power of its neighbors. For this reason, heat flows from the high temperature, high power assembly through the wrapper/inter-wrapper domain into the neighboring colder, lower power assemblies.

SCM calculates the duct temperature at the inner duct surface and that information is transferred to the heat conduction model to be used as a boundary condition. All other inter-wrapper/wrapper surfaces assume a Neumann boundary condition. The SCM calculated duct temperature and the transferred BC are shown in [Tduct] and [Tduct2].

In the 7 assembly example case the center assembly has twice the power of its neighbors. The wrapper/inter-wrapper region is hotter around the center assembly. In the 19 assembly case all the assemblies have the same power. The wrapper/inter-wrapper region has a uniform temperature profile.
