!alert note title=Acknowledgement
This VTB model was developed based on the baseline [!ac](SFR) metallic fuel modeling capabilities [!citep](Matthews2023Metal) and the BISON-[!ac](FIPD) integration framework [!citep](Miao2021X447,Miao2023X423).

This case is focused on the verification and validation (V&V) demonstration of the BISON's [!ac](SFR) metallic fuel performance models powered by integration with the [!ac](FIPD) database [!citep](Yacout2021FIPD), which maintains the steady-state fuel irradiation data collected during the [!ac](IFR) program. Pin DP11 irradiated in the experimental subassembly X447, which was designed to investigate the high-temperature effects on cladding degradation caused by [!ac](FCCI) and [!ac](CCCI), was selected to be the representative of the demonstration case.
