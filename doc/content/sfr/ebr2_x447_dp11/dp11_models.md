# Fuel Performance Models

!alert note title=Acknowledgement
The modeling approach introduced here was developed based on the baseline [!ac](SFR) metallic fuel performance models in BISON, which are described in details in [!citep](Matthews2023Metal).

## Geometry and Mesh

The 2D-RZ meshes for the X447 pins are generated with the intrinsic rodlet meshing capability in BISON's [`FIPDRodletMeshGenerator`](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/bison/source/meshgenerators/FIPDRodletMeshGenerator.html). The mesh generator directly reads the pin design parameter CSV file and generates the mesh along with a series of `MeshMetaData` to help ensure consistent use of pin geometry data throughout the simulations. Lower-dimensional elements are then added to the fuel and cladding contact surface sidesets with [`LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator`](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/bison/source/meshgenerators/LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator.html), which is automated by the corresponding `Contact` Action used in this model. These additional side elements serve as contact surfaces for the Lagrange multiplier variables parameterizing mortar contact.

## Material and Behavioral Models

The following material and behavioral models for the +U-10Zr fuel+ are used in this VTB model. Note that [`Automatic differentiation`](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/automatic_differentiation/index.html) is used in this model, as indicated by the "AD" prefix.

The following material and behavioral models for the +HT9 cladding+ were used in this VTB model:

As briefly mentioned above, some advanced MOOSE features, such as [`Automatic Differentiation`](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/automatic_differentiation/index.html) and mortar contact model, are employed by this VTB model. The mortar contact method was implemented for contact between the inner radial surface of the cladding and outer radial surfaces of the fuel. Both normal and tangential mechanical contact are modeled, with tangential contact including considerations of friction between the contact surfaces, parameterized by a friction coefficient, $\mu$. A value of $\mu$=0.1 was determined to as it leads to axial fuel growth values consistent with [!ac](PIE) observation.

Additionally, [`MetallicFuelWastageDegradationFunction`](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/bison/source/functions/MetallicFuelWastageDegradationFunction.html) is used to generate axial-dependent functions based on the [!ac](FCCI)/[!ac](CCCI) wastage thickness profiles recorded by corresponding `VectorPostprocessor`s. Such functions are directly used by cladding mechanical properties to artificially soften the cladding strength.
