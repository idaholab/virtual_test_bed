# Aerojet General Nucleonics 201 (AGN-201) Research Reactor Model Mesh

!alert warning
This meshing script generates a mesh in a coarse form. Convergence studies for the physics of interest should be performed by the user.

The cylindrical core mesh is created in several steps:

1. The top half core mesh boundary is generated:

    - The Shutdown Rod 1 (SR1) mesh is created.

    - The Coarse Control Rod (CCR) mesh is formed, the background is deleted, and the mesh is translated.

    - The top half core Central Irradiation Facility (CIF) boundary is produced.

2. The parts of the top half of the core are then stitched together.

3. The top half core meshes for the inner graphite layer and CIF wall are formed.

4. The universal beam ports (UBP) are meshed in several steps:

    - The outer layers (gas, lead, air gap, reactor tank, and water layers) between the beam ports are meshed.

    - The UBP inner walls are meshed.

    - The UBP channels inside the layers (gas, lead, air gap, reactor tank, and water layers) are meshed.

    - The UBP outer walls are meshed.

5. The CIF wall sections and outer graphite, lead, air gap, reactor tank, and water layers that are past the UBP channels are modeled.

6. The top half 2D core mesh is reflected and stitched to create a 2D mesh of the full core.

7. The Fine Control Rod (FCR), Shutdown Rod 2 (SR2), and CCR are explicitly defined and stitched to the 2D full core mesh.

8. The thermal fuse is modeled and stitched to the 2D full core mesh.

9. The mesh is extruded from 2D to 3D and the walls with channels are homogenized, resulting in the final AGN-201 mesh.


A more detailed explanation of each step follows below.

## Top Half of 2D Core

First, the top half core boundary mesh is generated from a curve describing a half circle.

!listing agn/3D_AGN-201_Final.i block=Mesh/top_half_core_boundary

Then, the SR1 hole base mesh is formed. The background is deleted and then translated.

!listing agn/3D_AGN-201_Final.i start=[sr1_base] end=[ccr_base]

The CCR hole base mesh is created, the background is deleted, and then the mesh is translated.

Then the core region is meshed inside the core outer boundary and outside the holes for the CCR and SR1 rods.

## Core Inner Graphite and CIF

The top inner graphite core boundary mesh is constructed from the equations for its curve, then the inside region is triangulated, and lastly stitched to the top half core 2D mesh.

!alert note
These two regions could be meshed with QUAD elements, using a `FillBetweenCurvesGenerator`.
