# Gas-cooled Microreactor Assembly Model Description

The Gas-Cooled Microreactor (GC-MR) assembly model was developed at ANL as a modeling experiment that gathers several expected modeling challenges encountered by the U.S. industry. The GC-MR assembly uses a graphite structure, TRISO fuel blocks with 19.95 at% LEU fuel, YH2 moderator pins with FeCrAl envelope, and upper/lower BeO reflector regions. Additional modeling specificities were implemented in the GC-MR such as burnable poison blocks, helium coolant channels and a central control and shutdown rod.
[Fig_1] illustrates the GC-MR assembly model.

| SiC | 387.5E-4 | 3.171 |
| PyC2 | 427.5E-4 | 1.882 |

The B4C poison particles have the following regions

| Region | Outer Radius (cm) | Density ($g/cm^{3}$) |

| PyC1 | 141.0E-4 | 1.882 |

The following thermal conductivities are used for modeling heat conduction. Certain materials have dedicated MOOSE (BISON) objects to represent their thermal properties as functions of temperature, while others can use a nominal value:

Either a specific value or a more detailed BISON model that computes thermal conductivity as a function of temperature is specified.
