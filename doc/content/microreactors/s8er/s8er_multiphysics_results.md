## Results

Plots of the power density and temperature spatial profile are reported in [griffin_pd] [bison_pd], respectively. It is noticeable that both power and temperature peak in the center. This is expected based on the uniform enrichment in the core. The Griffin results were also compared in standalone fashion (i.e., no thermal feedback) with the Serpent results that are validated against experimental results showing agreement within ~300 pcm.

## Future Work

Future work can be devoted to improving the model fidelity by creating a 3D model and by simulating the NaK flow with SAM or Pronghorn. The results from the improved model will then be compared with experimental results in a systematic way, therefore providing validation for NEAMS-based tools against experimental data.
