# Griffin Open Xe-100 Results

The result files include the binary files from the steady-state case, which serve
as initial conditions for the null and IQS cases; the pke_params `csv` files from
the null and IQS cases that contain the generated PKE parameters; the regular `csv`
files which contain regular output from the steady-state, null, and IQS cases;
and the pke_fuel_auto `csv` which is output from the PKE case. This contains the
results of the reproduction of the temperature transient in the IQS case.

A brief summary of the results for the SPH-corrected cross sections follows.
For a more detailed explanation, see Stewart et al. [!citep](Stewart2022).

## Steady-State Results

The steady-state $k_{eff}$ generated by Griffin for the constant temperature of
$900 K$ was 1.32988. This was compared to the Serpent model for this same reactor,
which had a $k_{eff}$ of 1.32987 with an uncertainty of 4.3E-05. Therefore, the
Griffin-calculated $k_{eff}$ was within the statistical uncertainty of the Serpent
value.

The steady-state scalar and adjoint fluxes are show in [ss_flux_distributions].

## PKE Parameters and Reactivity Coefficients

Generated PKE parameters compared with Serpent values are shown in [pke_params].

[global_reactivity_coeffs] shows the global reactivity coefficients that were generated
using three methods, as described in Stewart et al.[!citep](Stewart2022). It should be noted that
the dynamic reactivity must be scaled by $k_{eff}$ because Griffin uses $k_{eff}$
to scale the transport equation; the scaling allows Griffin
to obtain a stable configuration during the transient, resulting a larger
reactivity coefficient. When the reactivity coefficients are divided by the
steady-state $k_{eff}$, the values shown are obtained. The values in parentheses
are the percent difference from the Serpent coefficients.

Local reactivity coefficients were also calculated on a per element basis. [ss_local_reactivity_coeffs]
shows the steady-state case.
