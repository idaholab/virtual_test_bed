## Model Description

This model represents a greatly simplified version of the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT).
The model explores the effect on pulse feedback mechanisms from microscale heterogeneity represented by hypothetical 20 $\mu$m LEU fuel grains.
This model couples the heat equation with the neutron governing equation for temperature feedback during a short pulse.
The pulse is produced by inserting a reactivity of 4.56 % $\Delta$ k/k.
The model's simplified geometry consists of a homogeneous cube of TREAT-like fuel surrounded by a cube shell reflector.
The simplified geometry has no cladding, coolant channels, or other structures [!citep](zabriskie2019).
To reduce computation costs, symmetric boundaries are applied to a 1/8th quadrant of the simplified reactor, which is shown in [cube].
Outer boundaries on the reflector have vacuum and adiabatic boundary conditions for neutron and heat transport.

The dimensions of the macro-scale simulation model are given in [cubedim], and the fuel grain characteristics are given in [fgdim].

!table id=cubedim caption=Reflected cube reactor dimensions.

| Reflector mesh element cube length | $5.08$ |

The neutronics analysis is performed on a mesh characterized by centimeter-sized elements, while grain treatment is on the micrometer element scale where heat conduction problems are solved on microscopic domains encompassing a single fuel grain and a proportional amount of graphite.
This model makes use of the Griffin code for neutron transport and the MOOSE heat transfer module for heat transport and radiation. Serpent 2 was used to prepare cross section libraries
[!citep](zabriskie2019), [!citep](doi:10.1080/00295639.2018.1528802).

The particles are spaced $13.52$ cm apart in a regular grid lattice, and are spaced half that distance when next to a boundary.
There are $125$ particles in each octant of the full reactor.

The power density, calculated from the sampled flux at each location, is transferred to a single microscale simulation.

The MOOSE MultiApp system handles the multiscale and information transfer needs of the simulation.
The macroscale simulation provides the average temperature at each microscale simulation location as an outer boundary condition. With the sampled flux at each location and this outer boundary condition, the thermal solution of each microscale grain provides an average moderator shell temperature and fuel grain temperature to the locations in the macroscale simulation. These average temperatures then adjust the cross section, providing temperature feedback.

```

## Output Files

When the main input file is run, many output files will be generated.

Most of these have the format [!style color=blue](`out~refcube_micro_<number>`) as either CSV (.csv) or Exodus (.e) files.
These files are output by the main input file.
These files contain the postprocessor values specified in the `[Postprocessor]` block for each of the fuel grains.
The main input file will also output a CSV file containing the PKE parameters, called [!style color=blue](`out~refcube_pke_params.csv`).

Each of the four input files will output a CSV file and an Exodus file in the format [!style color=blue](`<input_file_name>_out.csv`) or [!style color=blue](`<input_file_name>_exodus.e`).
These files will contain the postprocessor values specified in the corresponding `[Postprocessor]` block.
