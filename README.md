Welcome to the Virtual Test Bed (VTB) repository!

This repo is a National Reactor Innovation Center ([NRIC](https://nric.inl.gov/)) initiative aiming to facilitate the use of advanced modeling & simulation (M&S) tools developed by the Department of Energy [NEAMS program](https://inl.gov/neams/). Following the passage of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, NRIC was created for accelerating the deployment of these novel reactor concepts. This will be achieved by providing both physical and virtual spaces for building and testing various components, systems, and complete pilot plants. The VTB represents the virtual arm in collaboration with DOE's NEAMS program.

The VTB repository hosts a wide variety of example challenge problems based on advanced reactor designs. Please refer to the [documentation website](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/virtual_test_bed/) for background and documentation for each use case.
